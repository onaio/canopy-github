# canopy-github
Source of GitHub labels and templates for canopy projects

Add issue labels to this project that should be standard across all canopy-related repositories, as well as any github issue or PR templates we may want to standardize.

We can use a [hosted label-sync](https://label-sync.herokuapp.com/) to copy labels to repos when required.
